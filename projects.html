            <p>
                Utilized PyGames to create a 2D array with a ship at the bottom of the screen. It shot targets that would shift down while running the game. 
                Worked with a Raspberry Pi to connect to a 3D-printed Gameboy. 
                Wrote a Python script to detect key pressing through pins of Raspberry Pi to trigger an action in the game.

                In a virtual world game, houses and routers were connected to the streets and zones. 
                Objects in the game were created with high-level code to perform tasks such as being a calculator or a Pig Latin translator. 
                Other objects like cubes created in-game chat messages, triangles held multiplication tables, and cones held vowel monster machines that transformed consonants into vowels.

                Created a calculator class and utilized `tkinter` to define the calculator UI. It allowed users to input numbers & perform calculations by pressing buttons on the interface. 
                Included error handling, such as catching division-by-zero errors with try/except blocks to avoid crashes.
