            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Britney Lopez, a fourth-year undergraduate Computer Science major at CalState Fullerton. I have a strong foundation in technical and creative problem-solving. 
                My journey has included transferring from Pasadena Community College to the University of Irvine, and finally landing where I am now. My initial plan was to pursue a 
                non-technical major and changed to a technical one. Despite the change of mind, I am very dedicated to absorb as much as possible and give it my all in all courses.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a very curious individual who loves learning and enjoys tinkering with new skills I learn. When I'm not coding or designing projects, I'll be out and about enjoying time with friends and family. 
                I love being creative, personalizing gifts, or trying new hobbies that my friends enjoy. I've always valued making moments meaningful, which is why I think art, music, and hands-on projects that let me 
                bring ideas to life are worthwhile.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I love trying new hobbies that let me express myself and show who I am or what I value. Music and dance have always been a source of energy for me. It's an easy fix to my mood. I also really enjoy experimenting 
                with new ideas and projects, which is why I think my path has changed a few times. Learning about so many different disciplines allows me to better understand people and their passion for what they pursue. 
                Balancing creativity, curiosity, and connection is what keeps me grounded and inspired.
